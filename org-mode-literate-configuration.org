#+MACRO: lp-configure-each-sb Configuration likely per Source-Block or System.

This system enables you to perform 3 Literate Document activities
- Tangling
- Evaluating
- Weaving

Combined they provide a rich Literate Programming environment.

These activities are not performed interactively by the user. They are automatic
operations that occur as a result of the configuration by the document itself.

The following is the guide for the default configuration of this system and how
it behaves.

Key:

- Columns
  - S :: Source document modified?
  - T :: Destination tangled-document modified?
  - W :: Destination weaved-document modified?
  - C :: Source-Block Evaluation occurred?
  - O :: Org-Macro Expansion occurred?

| Activity   | S | T | W | C  | O |
|------------+---+---+---+----+---|
| Tangling   | F | T | F | F  | F |
| Evaluating | T | F | F | T  | F |
| Weaving    | F | F | T | F! | T |

They are separate and distinct operations.

"Programming" is logically an activity that is the combination of these 3
activites. It is interactively performed by Sysop. It is not a distinct
or isolated operation. Results of one activity exist here and serve as inputs to
another activity.

- Note about ~F!~: Weaving Source-Block Evaluation occurred?^{*}
  - Source block evaluation on export is disabled using header arguments:
    those source blocks will never be evaluated on weaving
  - However the /ability/ for them evaluate on weaving /is/ enabled so that weaved
    source blocks can be replaced by their result value. This gives a kind of
    template system. More details [[eval][here]]

There is a way to disable property inheritance that speeds up tangling a lot.
This is only for user-defined properties; *not* Org-Mode properties.

The problem is that you lose property inheritance which is unacceptable. Never,
never allow that. Its inconsistent with how Org-Mode works.

- Post tangle actions
  - Indentation
    - At first glance this is surprising! The author should be responsible for
      the indentation, right? Yes, that is right. But there is one exception:
      using ~:noweb-ref~ source block concatenation. [[http://orgmode.org/manual/noweb_002dref.html][It]] is powerful and elegant.
      But the source blocks are indented on their own line. It forces any
      reader format it to make any sense of it. That is a poor start to using
      the tangled files. So tangled files get indented.

~org-export-use-babel~

How does this overlap with the ~:eval~ header arg? Are they the same or
different? What is the point? For a while I thought I understood the
difference and how it worked. Later when I ran into a problem with my exports
I realized that I didn't understand the difference!

I thought that I had configured inline source blocks to

1) Have their results replaced on each export
2) Only include their results, excluding their source code
3) Allow execution of source blocks interactively, never on export

It is all documented here [[Literate Programming]].

Instead of that, when I exported, the results /weren't/ replaced and the source
code /was/ included: exactly the opposite of what I had wanted to happen. Ouch!

Source blocks include a header arg ~:eval~ that controls evaluation of source
blocks. I'd configured them all (both normal source blocks and inline source
blocks) with the setting "never-export". Never-export makes it so that you can
evaluate source blocks when you are editing the document but they can never be
evaluated during export. That is why #3 worked correctly. But I will still
stuck with #1-#2.

Long story short after reviewing what I was thought every setting regarding
evaluating and exportation I ended up on ~org-export-use-babel~. It seemed silly
to read it's documentation again because I'd read it so many times that I
though I knew it inside and out: it controls whether or not code blocks /can/ be
evaluated on export. I'd set it to true though, to be totally sure that the
system worked as I had expected. Now *two* places disabled evaluation on export:
header args and this variable. It was here though that my understanding had a
major mistake!

~org-export-use-babel—~ answers two questions (controls two features) with one
answer:

1) Is code evaluated on export?
2) Are header args obeyed?

The key is the second part: the header args must be obeyed to make ~replace~
work. My problem was that I never noticed that this variable controls both
execution and header args use. The latter, somehow I totally missed that. So
no matter how I configured the header-args, those results /could never/ be
replaced because the header-args are *totally ignored*. Wow, I was so happy to
discover this.

In the end the configuration was super simple: set ~org-export-use-babel~ to
true, make sure the desired source blocks were set to ~:never-export~, and the
inline source blocks were setup to replace.

For some situations, this may be the same for every source block for a
particular language. The user manual described ~gnuplot~, which often shows up on
the list and the solution is to ~reset~ the session.

Another example, say that you've got a bunch of R Source-Blocks and you want to
be able to rearrange them as you please. You want to be sure that there are no
dependencies between them on bindings created in the workspace. Set ~prologue~
to ~rm(list = ls())~.

Epilgue works hand-in-hand with this.

Ways to configure =:results=: src_emacs-lisp{(apply '* (-keep 'cdr '((Collection . 2) (Type . 4) (Format . 7) (Handling . 4))))} {{{results(=224=)}}}.

This system stores the results of evaluation in the source document. It believes
that the results are critical to the research.

Keep the document as close to being executable as possible; make it very visible
when it is not.

- Collection
  - =value=: Functions have a single result. So do Source-Blocks.
- Type
  - =scalar=
    - Functions always return a single result
    - Evidence demonstrates that I use this or =output= most of the time and I
      want to configure this to work right for =Literate Programming= by default
      because it feels better.
  - =WAS=
    - Because in theory returning a collection was flexible (see below). In
      practice I never ever used this.
    - =table=:
      - Tables are the best type because
        - Dimensions make them human-readable in text.
        - Work with Babel LP.
        - Appear as lists to programming languages.
        - Weaves well.
        - Inline Source-Blocks disallow tables so use scalars instead.
- Format
  - =drawer=: Enable results replacement
- Handling
  - =replace=: Replace them each time you evaluate the block.

Their format will show that they are results. Inline source blocks
automatically get formatted as verbatim. For some reason, this only needs to
be configured as =replace= to work unlike normal source blocks. Copying the
configuration from normal source blocks here breaks the replacement
functionality.
